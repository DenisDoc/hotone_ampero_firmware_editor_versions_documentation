Release notes --- Ampero Firmware Version 3.8SP1 :

Attention
If your Ampero's current firmware is V3.7 or earlier (if your Ampero's current firmware version is lower than V3.0, please read history firmware release note first and DO NOT update to V3.8SP1 directly), please read the "IMPORTANT" below carefully. If your Ampero's current firmware is V3.8, you only need to update it normally.

 

IMPORTANT – RE-CALIBRATE THE BUILT-IN EXPRESSION PEDAL AFTER UPDATE(CTRL/EXP > EXP 1 Settings  > Calibrate) since we optimized the built-in expression pedal with a new method.

Use V3.8SP1 firmware with Ampero Editor V1.3.0 ONLY. The patches ofearlier firmware versions are now NOT compatible with this V3.8SP1 firmware due to the new features and changes, which means, after updating firmware, in some situations, your unit may not work properly.  

Please export all patches by using previous Ampero Editor before updating, thenimport them again via new Ampero Editor. The Editor will automatically convert your old patch files to the new version, so that you can use them with V3.8SP1 firmware.

If you’re using 3rd-party IR files, when importing patches after update, the editor will notice you whether to keep CAB module settings. Please select "Keep" so that you can continue using your IR files.

If you accidentally updated to the new firmware before backing up your patches, you can still roll back to earlier firmware versions (load earlier firmware files when updating) before you edit/save patches with new firmware.

If you’re using special version firmwares (V3.3B, V3.3C, V3.3D), please note that the special version patches are no longer compatible with normal Ampero units.

 

Improvements, Changes & Bug Fixes
