Release notes --- Ampero Firmware Version 3.8:

Attention
This Ampero V3.8 firmware update brings you new effects, more powerful features (e.g. 10 more user IR slots and low/high cut control), optimized system performance and bug fixes. We recommend all Ampero users to execute this update for the best possible user experience.

IMPORTANT – RE-CALIBRATE THE BUILT-IN EXPRESSION PEDAL AFTER UPDATE(CTRL/EXP > EXP 1 Settings > Calibrate) since we optimized the built-in expression pedal with a new method.

Use V3.8 firmware with Ampero Editor V1.3.0 ONLY. The patches ofearlier firmware versions are now NOT compatible with this V3.8 firmware due to the new features and changes, which means, after updating firmware, in some situations, your unit may not work properly.  

Please export all patches by using previous Ampero Editor before updating, thenimport them again via new Ampero Editor. The Editor will automatically convert your old patch files to the new version, so that you can use them with V3.8 firmware.

If you’re using 3rd-party IR files, when importing patches after update, the editor will notice you whether to keep CAB module settings. Please select "Keep" so that you can continue using your IR files.

If you accidentally updated to the new firmware before backing up your patches, you can still roll back to earlier firmware versions (load earlier firmware files when updating) before you edit/save patches with new firmware.
